Contares_EYE mod parts and science definition are inspired by early reconnaissance systems.

Contares_EYE require following mods to work perfect:

RealPlume for visual effects of rocket engines
Ship Manifest to transfer earned science from part to part without crew 
ScanSat to use the altimeter (altimetry scan) and SAR (altimetry and biome scan) radar components

Many of the included parts are very small, so it was not possible to create separate decoupler 
without making operation in the VAB impossible. Please take a look at the context menu of the 
parts to recognize and understand the existing functions.
