		KerbinFlyingHigh = The cameras are started and 100 meters of film are taken as a series, developed and wound up safely. This will certainly be exceptional photos only it is getting a bit too hot!
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The cameras are started and 100 meters of film are taken as a series, developed and wound up safely. Just bring the footage back safely!
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = The cameras are started and 100 meters of film are taken as a series, developed and wound up safely. Unfortunately the orbit is to high!

	RESULTS
	{
	default = You take a picture of whatever the camera is pointing at. Pretty.
	KebolInSpaceHigh = She is very bright and very beautiful. Kerbol, the star that keeps Kerbalkind alive... 
	KerbolInSpaceLow = The light coming off Kerbol has made the image pure white! You're lucky you didn't damage the camera...
	MohoInSpaceHigh = Moho floats far away, punished with craters. You can almost see the heat of the home star, Kerbol... 
	MohoInSpaceLow = Craters become clear on Moho's surface. With immense detail, the craters have craters. This reminds you that you are too close for comfort... 
	MohoSrfLanded = After your descent, you see the distinct features of the planet. Craters are visible as far as the eye can see. 
	EveInSpaceHigh = Eve shimmers with its purple hue down below you. Or was it up? You can't remember... 
	EveInSpaceLow = Eve greets you with great delight as you swoop past, revealing how vast her Explodium Oceans are. You now want a grape popsicle... 
	EveSrfLanded = The purple sand of this dense planet stretches across the surface. You get hungry and wonder if this sand is toxic if eaten... 
	GillyInSpaceHigh = Gilly barely resembles a dot in the photo. 
	GillyInSpaceLow = Gilly, a beige captured asteroid reveals very extreme terrain. A blur in the photo shows its fast rotation. 
	GillySrfLanded = The photo shows a wide variety of mountains. There is really nothing else here. 
	KerbinInSpaceHigh = There is something very familiar about all this water and land you see. 
	KerbinInSpaceLow = Who knew the space agency would be spying on all these Kami's and Kato's? 
	KerbinSrfLanded = Haven't you seen this before? 
	MunInSpaceHigh = The Mun appears to be very cratered while the lowlands sit pristinely below all of the mountains. 
	MunInSpaceLow = Closer to the moon now, you see that craters have ravaged the surface. Even the plains are unforgiven, which makes you infer that time has taken its toll on the Mun's surface... 
	MunSrfLanded = The ground is very grey. Around you, there are slopes and mountains.
	MinmusInSpaceHigh = From so far away, Minmus resembles a small scoop of mint ice cream... 
	MinmusInSpaceLow = Minmus reveals varying terrain. High plateaus stretch for kilometres and the plains below them stretch even farther. 
	MinmusSrfLanded = The minty colored surface amazes you as you stare above and below where you have taken this photo. 
	DunaInSpaceHigh = The pale orange dot resembles a ball or rust, or a red velvet cupcake...
	DunaInSpaceLow = Duna has a vide variety of terrain, ranging from deep chasms, to tall mountain ranges, and plains. Its ice caps are large and dominant of the poles. 
	DunaSrfLanded = The red dirt below you appears to be coarse and dry. Wait, did that rock move between photos?
	IkeInSpaceHigh = The rock we call Ike is massive. It appears to be quite dense from so far away. It also appears to have very rugged terrain, more so than your own moon. 
	IkeInSpaceLow = Ike shows its weathered terrain quite clearly. Mountain ranges dominate the surface while the plains come in dark, large patches. 
	IkeSrfLanded = The pictures show rocky evidence of recent tectonic activity. 
	DresInSpaceHigh = Dres reminds you of the Mun. It holds quite uneven terrain with a grey hue. 
	DresInSpaceLow = Closer to Dres now, you begin to collect evidence that she is not a planet, but she is a dwarf planet which once was a gargantuan rogue asteroid. 
	DresSrfLanded = The surface is barren with intermittent hills surrounding you. The flat areas you once saw, are not as flat as you thought. 
	JoolInSpaceHigh = Jool's many moons are seen fantastically before her like a ballet of crumbs around that key lime cake you just devoured. 
	JoolInSpaceLow = The green hue of Jool dominates the photo with great immensity. 
	LaytheInSpaceHigh = From here, Laythe looks like a pale blue marble. 
	LaytheInSpaceLow = Laythe has islands, water, and an atmosphere. You wouldn't be suprised if we found microkerbals here... 
	LaytheSrfLanded = The sandy beaches with dunes and pristine waters make you think of Kerbin. 
	VallInSpaceHigh = Vall stands valiant, far away, as a pale blue dot. 
	VallInSpaceLow = Vall holds blue plains and lighter blue mountains ranges that snake around the planet's surface in every which way. 
	VallSrfLanded = There are no even landing spots on this moon. Perhaps it is a consequence of cryo-volcanism or the tidal forces exerted on Vall. 
	TyloInSpaceHigh = Tylo, from so far out, appears to be speckled. Why didn't we name it Spot? 
	TyloInSpaceLow = Tylo is humongous. It is a massive rock the size of Kerbin. The speckles turn out to be tens of thousands of craters. Tylo reveals a highly beaten surface like the Mun. The scientists in the lab infer that Tylo does indeed have trace amounts of cobalt. 
	TyloSrfLanded = Tylo holds a very dusty surface. The craters seen from above appear to be just another surface feature now. 
	BopInSpaceHigh = Bop seems to be a brown captured asteroid not unlike Gilly. Perhaps they are related?
	BopInSpaceLow = Bop appears to reveal a crater with a white rim, which perhaps, could be evidence of a young captured Bop in a young Joolian system. 
	BopSrfLanded = Bop gives off a peculiar vibe. It is very dark and desolate. Was it once a comet? 
	PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, the speck across the way, reminds you of a pollen grain. 
	PolInSpaceLow = Pol seems unforgiving. Like her sister Bop, she seems to be a captured asteroid. The rough, jagged, and derranged terrain make you think twice about landing. 
	PolSrfLanded = Apparently, you landed. The yellow and khaki colored surface seems nice. Oh wait, are you sliding down the cliff?? 
	EelooInSpaceHigh = Eeloo appears to be very icy. It's spent too long this far away from Kerbol.  
	EelooInSpaceLow = Eeloo shows its true self as you approach, revealing her ice canyons and chasms. 
	EelooSrfLanded = Eeloo appears to show evidence of a once thin atmosphere. Possibly there are hidden cryo-volcanos that spray gases into the vaccum, intermittently causing a temporary atmosphere.
